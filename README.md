# RGB Filter by Pixel

The fact is one of the most important code in image processing is filtering, and filters comes in many forms.
The following is a filter using RGB Color Space, to filter pixel by pixel, and below shows RGB Color Space, filtered image with certain values of RGB, and a method shows how to approximate the values needed for RGB filtering to detect one Faces for example. Â 

Looking forward to see your contributions, feel free to contact me anytime :).
